# Copying a Image

### how it works
The web has a native clipboard api that allows you to save data to the user clipboard.  It normally only used for putting text into images but it can be used to save images to as well.  The way the api works is not completely implemented across all browsers so i use a library called [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com).  A demo on how it works can be found [here](https://jsfiddle.net/p83gp77c/)
